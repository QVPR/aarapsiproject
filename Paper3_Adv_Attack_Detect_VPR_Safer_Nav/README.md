These scripts are for our IEEE ICRA paper (publication pending review):
# Adversarial Attacks and Detection in Visual Place Recognition for Safer Robot Navigation
These scripts rely on our Python module, [pyaarapsi](https://github.com/QVPR/pyaarapsi), and work best with version [v0.2.2](https://github.com/QVPR/pyaarapsi/tree/v0.2.2)

Our data sets can be downloaded from Google Drive, and are labelled to the environment, condition, VPR descriptor, and whether they are for a reference or query set:
