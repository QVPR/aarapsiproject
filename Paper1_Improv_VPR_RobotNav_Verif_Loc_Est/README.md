These scripts are for our IEEE RA-L paper (publication pending review):
# Improving Visual Place Recognition Based Robot Navigation Through Verification of Localization Estimates
These scripts rely on our Python module, [pyaarapsi](https://github.com/QVPR/pyaarapsi), and work best with version [v0.4.0](https://github.com/QVPR/pyaarapsi/tree/v0.4.0) on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS. See ```Installation.md``` for more information.
